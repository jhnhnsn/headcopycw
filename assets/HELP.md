# The Koch Method

The Koch method is a proven technique for learning Morse code that builds reflexive responses to individual characters. Unlike traditional methods that start slow and gradually increase speed, the Koch method has you learn at your target speed from the very beginning.

## How It Works

1. **Start at full speed** - Choose your target speed (e.g., 20 WPM) and stick with it. Don't start slow and build up.

2. **Begin with two characters** - Set the Letters slider to 2. For your first sessions, you'll only practice two characters (K and M in the standard Koch order).

3. **Practice for 5 minutes** - Press Start and copy the characters you hear. Write them down on paper or say them to yourself for head copy practice.

4. **Check your accuracy** - After the session, compare what you copied with the text displayed on screen. Calculate your percentage of correct characters.

5. **Progress when ready** - When you achieve 90% accuracy or better, add the next character by increasing the Letters slider.

6. **Repeat** - Your accuracy will temporarily drop as you learn each new character, but it will rise again. Continue until you've mastered all 40 characters.

## Why This Method Works

- **Builds reflexes, not lookup tables** - By learning at full speed, you develop instant recognition rather than mentally translating each character.

- **Constant positive reinforcement** - After mastering your first two characters at full speed, you know you can do it. Each new character is proof of progress.

- **Efficient use of time** - You progress at your own pace, spending only the time needed for each character.

- **No plateau frustration** - Unlike starting slow and hitting a wall at 10 WPM, you're already copying at your target speed.

## Practice Modes

**Letters** - Practice individual characters using the Koch method. Use the Letters slider to control how many characters are in your practice set.

**Groups** - Practice random groups of 2 to N characters. Groups vary in length to ease the transition from random practice to real words.

**Words** - Practice real words from CW abbreviations, common English words, or words made only from learned letters.

**QSO** - Practice copying simulated amateur radio contacts, including callsigns, signal reports, names, and locations.

## Settings

**Actual Speed** - The character speed in WPM. This is how fast individual characters are sent.

**Effective Speed** - The overall speed including spacing. When lower than actual speed, extra space is added between elements.

**Farnsworth vs Wordsworth** - Farnsworth adds space between characters. Wordsworth adds space between words.

**Pitch** - The tone frequency (350-1500 Hz). Choose a pitch comfortable for extended listening.

**Display Delay** - How long to wait before showing text after it is sent. Longer delays encourage head copy.

**Session Length** - Practice duration in minutes. Set to 0 for unlimited sessions.

## Tips for Success

- Practice regularly. Short, frequent sessions are more effective than occasional long ones.

- Don't rush. Only add a new character when you consistently achieve 90% accuracy.

- Use head copy. Say each character to yourself rather than writing it down.

- Some days are harder. Your performance will vary, and some characters take longer to learn.

- Progress to words and QSOs once you learn the full character set.
