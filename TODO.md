# TODO – CW Trainer (G4FON-style)

Features from the [G4FON CW Trainer](https://www.g4fon.net/CW%20Trainer2.php) that are not yet implemented.

---

## Not implemented

- [ ] **Sending trainer** – Speak words; user sends back with a keyer. Would need mic / sound-card input to decode the keyer’s sidetone.

- [ ] **QRM generator** – Simulated QRM (noise or a second Morse stream) for harder copy practice. Configurable in Setup (e.g. contest-style).

- [ ] **Practice session logging** – Record time spent, lesson, speeds, and show a timeline/calendar (e.g. Practice History).

- [ ] **Audio books / export to WAV or MP3** – Turn long text (e.g. from Project Gutenberg) into Morse and export as WAV or MP3. G4FON enables this only after all characters are learned.

- [ ] **CWOps character order** – In Setup, allow choosing CWOps learning order instead of only the default Koch order.

- [ ] **Text file drag-and-drop** – Load a custom text file and play it in Morse (or send it in the main window). G4FON: drag file onto the main window; only after all characters are learned.

## Possible enhancements

- [ ] **Random group size** – In Groups mode, optionally randomize the group size (e.g. 3–7) instead of a fixed value.
- [ ] **Pause / resume** – Spacebar or button to pause and resume a running session (as in G4FON 10.6.3).
